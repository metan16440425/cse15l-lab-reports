Hi all,  

I'm working on a Java method to sort strings in a list by their length. However, it's not working as expected. I expect it to be in ascending order, but it is in descending order. When I run my tests, the strings don't seem to be sorted correctly. 

I suspect there might be an issue with the sorting logic or the comparison inside the sortByStringLength method.
